## Molecular Networking

**Q: My molecule of interest is not appearing in my classical molecular networking. What should I do?**

**A:**

1. **Ensure Inclusion:** First, make sure that your molecule is included in the network and not filtered out by the minimum cluster size setting (the default is 2).
2. **Check for Neighbors:** Next, check if your molecule has any neighboring connections in the network. 
3. **Examine Singletons:** To be thorough, examine the network including singletons.

**Q: How to show the singletons in a network?**

**A:**

At the classical_networking_workflow or feature_based_molecular_networking_workflow task result page, click "Visualize Full Network  w/ Singletons in Browser" in the "Network Visualizations" section.


**Q: I have a ton of data to analyze at GNPS2 but the File Uploader is slow, how do I get my data over there?**

**A:**

GNPS2 has an FTP/SFTP upload portal that is meant for close collaborators to be able to upload a significant amount of data. Otherwise, since GNPS2 does not have the ability to store massive amounts of data for the broader community, we recommend deposition of the data at a public repository such as MassIVE in order to do analysis of such data at GNPS2.
