## Plant Metabolomics Playground

This page highlights a repository scale dataset for the community to explore and play with for plant metabolomics. We've taken the effort in an upcoming manuscript that maps out the chemical heterogeneity of what the community has deposited. 

We provide these data with putative annotations for metabolite identifications using MS/MS data and we leave the door open to the community to help us annotate and explore it. 

### Positive Mode MS/MS Dataset

This dataset was clustered and analyzed in GNPS2 job [https://gnps2.org/status?task=c9a8a45365cf4cdf89b0afaf57df05d3](https://gnps2.org/status?task=c9a8a45365cf4cdf89b0afaf57df05d3). If you'd want to re-analyze it click here with your own MS/MS library.
