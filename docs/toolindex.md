# GNPS2 Tool Index

This is a global tool index for GNPS2. Throughout this documentation we have very detailed information for how to use way more tools than we thought we'd have, but it's a good problem to have!

However, we recognize it might be difficult for people to simply see what all is available in GNPS as tool and web services. This table is always evolving and hope to make it easier for people to navigate. 

Please help us fill in more completely!


## GNPS2 Web Tools

These are web tools that is run by the GNPS2 team and provides complementary functionality to GNPS2.

## Web Interfaces Description

### MassQL Post-MN

Enables users to perform spectral pattern-based queries directly on post-processed GNPS molecular networking outputs using the MassQL language.

[MassQL Post-MN](https://massqlpostmn.gnps2.org/)

### Multi-step MassQL

Allows construction of sequential MassQL queries, useful for identifying structurally related molecules (e.g., distinguishing isomers) through compound-specific fragmentation patterns.

[Multi-step MassQL](https://multistep-massql.gnps2.org/)

### Conjugated Metabolome Explorer

Facilitates the exploration of metabolite conjugation patterns across large datasets, aiding the identification of phase II metabolism products.

### Reverse Metabolomics

Enables querying of large repositories to identify metadata or sample types associated with specific molecular features, providing reverse-lookup functionality for biomarker discovery.

### MS/MS Spectrum Summary App

Here is a little app that can take a set of MS/MS spectra and understand the consistent fragmentation.

[Spectrum Summary App](https://spectrasummary.gnps2.org/)

### Molecular Networking Reformatting App

This little app can reformat molecular networking outputs to create tall tables to make downstream analysis a bit easier.

### Coauthor Summarizer

This app can take all of your publications and tell you who your coauthors were in the last n years. Pretty useful for NSF proposals. 

[Coauthor App](https://coauthor.wanglab.science/)

### TinyMass App

This app is like tinyurl but for mass spectra. You can easily share MS spectra and get a USI that can be used in a ton of different places

[TinyMass App](https://tinymass.gnps2.org/)

### USI Generation App

This app will help to create USIs from a variety of places from datasets to GNPS2 analysis jobs. Making it easier to interact with the rest of the ecosystem.

### MassQL Analysis App

This app makes working with MassQL a lot easier. 

You can do the following:

1. Play around with MassQL against MS/MS spectral libraries
2. Use an LLM to write and interact with MassQL queries for the first time
3. Use an LLM to explain the MassQL Queries

## GNPS2 Jupyter Notebooks

These notebooks are for postprocessing of results from GNPS/GNPS2 and other computational processing that have not been integrated yet. If they are super useful, we can integrate into high throughput workflows. For now, give them a try!
