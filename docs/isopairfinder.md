# IsoPairFinder
**IsoPairFinder** is a computational tool that identifies pathway intermediates by analyzing paired unlabeled (12C) and isotope-labeled (13C) metabolomics data from gene-edited microbes. By prioritizing substrate-specific feature pairs, IsoPairFinder dramatically reduces the chemical search space to enable efficient identification of biologically relevant intermediates.

- **GNPS2 workflow** - You can run IsoPairFinder in GNPS2 - [here](https://gnps2.org/workflowinput?workflowname=isopairfinder_nextflow_workflow).
- **R package** - The R package and source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DoddLab/IsoPairFinder).
- **Demo data** - The demo data can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/DoddLab/IsoPairFinder_demo_data).
- **Tutorials** - Comprehensive documentation is available [here](https://doddlab.github.io/IsoPairFinder/).

If you used IsoPairFinder in your research, please cite the following paper:
- Z. Zhou, Y. Liu, M. W, D. Dodd*, IsoPairFinder: A tool for biochemical pathway discovery using stable isotope tracing metabolomics, Submitted, 2025. [**bioRxiv**]().

## Input data
We will require the following files:

- **Feature tables** (comma-separated CSV files; unlabeled WT vs. unlabeled mutant and labeled WT vs. labeled mutant) contain differential feature results exported from common peak picking tools (XCMS, MSDIAL, MZmine, etc.). T**he protocols for data preparation of these tools** are detailed in the [**tutorials**](https://doddlab.github.io/IsoPairFinder_Tutorials/data_preparation.html).
- **Sample Information Table** (CSV file) defines the tracers and group information
- **Raw data files** (mzML/mzXML files) are the LC-MS data files for each sample.
- **MS/MS files** (mzML/mzXML/mgf format) are the MS/MS data files.

### Feature Table
- **peak_table_C12.csv**: the peak area table of the unlabeled group. 
    - The first 4 columns should be “id”, “mz”, “rt”, “ms1_isotopes”, and other columns are sample names.
- **peak_table_C13.csv**: the peak area table of the labeled group. 
    - The first 4 columns should be “id”, “mz”, “rt”, “ms1_isotopes”, and other columns are sample names.

```




### Sample Info 

- Column names: “sample_id”, “group”, “tracer_group”, and “type”.
    - **sample_id**: The sample ID, which should match the column names in the feature table, and should be same as the raw data file name.
    - **group**: <font color="red"> Your **wild type** samples must be the group **WT**, and the **mutant samples** must be **MUTANT**.</font>
    - **tracer_group**: 12C or 13C.
    - **type**: The **type** column defines the type of the sample, e.g., sample or control.

```
sample_id,group,tracer_group,type

WT_UA_2,WT,12C,sample
WT_UA_3,WT,12C,sample

```


### Raw Data & MS/MS Data
- mzML/mzXML files: The raw data files for each sample. <font color="red">The names of the raw data files should match the sample IDs in the sample information table.</font>
- MS/MS files: The MS/MS data files for each sample, which can be in <mark>mzML/mzXML/mgf format</mark>. The MS/MS data of Pooled samples are recommended.
