## Introduction

The main documentation for **Feature-Based Molecular Networking** [can be accessed here](docs/fbmn.md). See [our article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0933-6).

Below we describe how to use **Progenesis QI** with the FBMN workflow on [GNPS2](https://gnps2.org/homepage).

## Using Progenesis QI and the Feature-Based Molecular Networking on GNPS

Progenesis QI is a proprietary LC-MS feature detection and alignment software developed by [Nonlinear Dynamics](http://www.nonlinear.com/progenesis/qi/) that is compatible with Waters file format and other proprietary and open mass spectrometry format.

Progenesis QI can perform feature detection, alignment and annotation of non-targeted LC-MS/MS data acquired either **in data-dependent analysis (DDA)** or **MSE data independent analysis (DIA)**, and can also uses the **ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) dimension**. Feature-based molecular networking (FBMN) can be performed on **any of these data types processed with Progenesis QI**.
