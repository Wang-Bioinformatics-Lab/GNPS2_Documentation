# Feature-Based Molecular Networking (FBMN)

## Introduction

[**NEW !!!**] The FBMN allows to generate molecular networks from MSE and Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) data with MS-DIAL, or Progenesis QI, MetaboScape.

**Feature-Based Molecular Networking** (FBMN) is a computational method that bridges popular mass spectrometry data processing tools for LC-MS/MS and molecular networking analysis on [GNPS2] (https://gnps2.org) and [GNPS](http://gnps.ucsd.edu). The supported tools are: [MZmine](featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-mzmine2.md), [OpenMS](featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-openms.md), [MS-DIAL](featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-ms-dial.md), [MetaboScape](featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-metaboscape.md), [XCMS](featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-xcms3.md), [Progenesis QI](featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-progenesisQI.md), and the [mzTab-M format](featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-mztab-m.md).

The main documentation for **Feature-Based Molecular Networking** is provided below. See [our article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0933-6)
