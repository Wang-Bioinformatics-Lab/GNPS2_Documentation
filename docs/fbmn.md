# Feature-Based Molecular Networking (FBMN)

## Introduction

**Feature-Based Molecular Networking** (FBMN) is a computational method that bridges popular mass spectrometry data processing tools for LC-MS/MS and molecular networking analysis on [GNPS2](https://gnps2.org) and [GNPS](http://gnps.ucsd.edu). 

The main documentation for **Feature-Based Molecular Networking** is provided below. See [the Nature Methods article here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0933-6).
