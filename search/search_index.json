De Jonge et al. for annotating MS2 spectra, by finding the best match in mass spectral libraries. What makes MS2Query unique is that it will also return analogues if no good exact match is available. An analgoue is a metabolite that is chemically very similar to your metabolite, but can have some modifications. Analogues can be a great starting point for annotation, or can help you to prioritize metabolites/spectra for further analysis.  Including analogues increases the number of spectra for which you get some results by a lot, thereby making it possible to learn more from your data!</p> <p>MS2Query gives more results and more reliable predictions compared to previous methods for library matching, like (modified) cosine score or MS2Deepscore.  MS2Query uses previously developed machine learning algorithms (MS2Deepscore and Spec2Vec) to predict chemical similarity between your spectra and library spectra.  MS2Query is able to improve the reliability of the predicitons a lot by not directly picking the highest predicted similarity, but looking at many predictions for similar library metabolites first, to make sure the potential match is not a false positive.

This score ranges between 0 and 1, the closer this score is to 1 the more likely that it is a good match/analogue. It is important to use this score to select only the reliable hits, since a prediction is given for each spectrum, regardless of the ms2query score. There is no strict minimum for this score, but the higher the MS2Query model prediction the more likely it is a good match/analogue. It will depend on your research goal, what a good threshold is. If a high recall is important you might want a low threshold and if a high reliability is more important you might want a high threshold. To give a general indication, a score &gt; 0,7 has many good analogues and exact matches.

If it is important to separate potential exact matches from potential analogues for your research question, the column with the precursor mz difference can be used to separate these results, since exact matches should have no precursor mz difference.
